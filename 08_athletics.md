ATHLETICS

    
FOOTBALL TEAM OF ’09
While our football team during
the past season did not achieve the
success thev desired, or that we
naturally wished for them, we seem
to have had, in light of present facts,
a much better team than we had
imagined.
Many of our men being new at
the game, we lo>t several games we
should have won early in the season,
and owing to a chain of unfortunate
circumstances the team seemed,
later on, not to have struck that
winning gait which we had predicted
for them; but when we consider the
fact that Hopkins beat us 9 to 0 and
d IfLto 0, and,tins
fact mat St. Johns

W'e greatly regret that the scarlet
fever scare at the college prevented
our annual game with St. Johns, for
notwithstanding the superiority of
St. Johns' record over our own, we be
lieve that our boys would have given
a splendid account of themselves in
the game, and would have furnished
to our friends from Annapolis a
larger proposition than they had
bargained for.
Let us say, right here that St.
Johns had one of the best football
teams in this part of the country,
cpniii have secured no

will soon- cTrnv.iiig stride

of Those years.
TRACK TEAM
It probably takes longer to develop
a good track man than it does to
produce a good man in any other de
partment of athletic sports.
