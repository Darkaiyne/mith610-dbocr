SOCIAL STUNTS

    
The social life.of College has been
well kept up during the fall months.
The Faculty has always realized the
importance of all social events and
has encouraged us in them. Since
September we have had three
dances, together with several other
interesting happenings.
Soon after the college work had
gotten well under way in September,
the Rossburg Club held a meeting,
elected their officers and outlined
their plan for the coming season.
Drum Major Jackson P. Grason was
elected president; Major 0. U.
Saunders, vice president, and Lieu
tenant Win. P. Cole, secretary
treasurer. Major Saunders was ap
point'd Chairman of the Reception
Cmumitt >e; Contain Tvd'm Vis of the
invitation m 1 Program (’mnmittee;
Captain Adams of the Floor and
Amusement Committee, and Captain
Allen of the Refreshment Commit
tee. The work was quickly begun
and the (irst regular Rossburg dance
of the fall season of 1909 was held
on October 29.
On the Friday after Thanksgiving
we were treated to our second dance.
H was given by the Trustees and the
arrangements made by the officers of
the Rossburg Club. Our friends were
unanimous in pronouncing it one of
the best dances ever given at
M. A. C., and all those present wish
to take this opportunity to offer to
the Trustees our cordial thanks for
their kindness. The floor committee
canvassed the barracks for pennants,
with which they arranged a small
reception room in the north entrance
of the hall. By the use of crepe
paper, they transformed the ceiling
of the main room into an orange and
black canopy. The refreshment com
mittee provided chicken salad and
rolls, followed by ice cream, cake and
coffee.
