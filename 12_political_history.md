HBSBPPPF: with great pleasure
of Maryland polities,
being published weekly in the Balti
more “Sunday Sun.”
These articles are from the pen of
Mr a Van 1 v, - I+r -K errt, secrefary and
treasurer of this college.
Mr. Kent is not only an able and
attractive writer, but the historical
data presented in the articles gives
evidence of remarkable study and
research.
Every citizen of Maryland, and
especially young men about to as
sume the re ponsi hi 1 itv of citizen

    
ship, would do well to read this
history of the politics of our State.
It lias been said that the true
value of history, as it applies to na
tions, is to instruct a man how to
become a good citizen of his own
country. Then certainly we should
study the political history of our
own State, and receive those impres
sions and make those deductions
which will lead to the proper
conception of our civic duty as sons
of the grand old commonwealth of
Maryland.
